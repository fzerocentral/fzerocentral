1. Accepted ways to play:

    - The original Nintendo 64 game cartridge
    - The Wii Virtual Console release
    - The Wii U Virtual Console release - the **Save State Rules** below apply to restore points
    - The Switch Online release - the **Save State Rules** below apply to suspend points
    - (**Expansion Kit Ladder only**) A flash cartridge ("Flashcart"), with an unaltered ROM of the original game - see the **Flashcart Rules** and **Save State Rules** below

    Unofficial emulators are not allowed. Flashcarts are not allowed for ladders other than the Expansion Kit Ladder.

1. The use of cheat devices such as Action Replay are forbidden on the ladder. If it is suspected that a cheat device has been used then that player will have their times removed from the ladder.

1. Modifying and/or tinkering with the hardware to improve your times is prohibited. things like the Crooked Cartridge glitch (pulling the cart out a bit from the N64 while still playing) and altering the controllers with things such as Lego to make a turbo button are banned. if you have times set using these kind of modifications, they should be changed inmediately.


## Save State Rules

When submitting runs to the FZC ladder, save states, restore points, etc. may only be used as described below.

**3-Laps:** Before the timer of the 3-lap attempt first starts.

**Fast Laps:** Before Boost Power and/or any advanced technique is performed that leads into the fast lap being attempted (example: the save state must be set before starting the AGG setup for a fast lap)


## Normal X ladder and Death Race Ladder Rules

1. Any engine settings may be used.

1. You may only use the normal 30 vehicles. You may not use the Super Falcon, Super Stingray, Super Cat, or any custom vehicles.

1. Any glitches/techniques may be used except for pulling the corner of the N64 cartridge.

1. Only submit times that are shown on your records screen.


## Expansion Kit Ladder Rules

1. All engine settings may be used.

1. You may use any vehicle, including custom vehicles.

1. Any glitches/techniques may be used except for pulling the corner of the N64 cartridge.

1. Only submit times that are shown on your records screen.

### Flashcart Rules

Due to how difficult it is to obtain a 64DD and Expansion Kit and how much flash carts have advanced in the last decade, it's been decided that times set using one of these will be allowed with certain conditions:

1. You must use either an Everdrive 64 v2.5 or v3 or a 64Drive flash cart. these are the only ones tested by the community to work correctly with the FZX + EK combined rom.

1. No cheat codes are allowed. the flash carts posses cheat code functionality but it should be avoided at any cost. patches aren't allowed either.

1. Only the japanese FZX + EK rom is allowed. we want to ensure there's no difference between the game played on real hardware and played with the flash carts. using the unmodified combined rom is the closest to that. also, patching a normal FZX rom with EK tracks is not allowed since there's a couple of differences between the regular rom and the combined rom.

1. When using a flash cart to set times, you must mention it in the comments section.

Proof will be handled in the same fashion as in the rest of the games. that means you need video proof if you get a WR time or very close to it.

Video proof is important given the possibilities of modification, which means times set with a flashcart will be under tighter scrutiny.

as a special note, it's still not allowed to use a flash cart with the regular tracks in the regular ladder.


## Jumper Ladder Rules

1. Only jumper engine settings may be used. This means that the engine setting on the pick-up graph has to be within four ticks of the right side of the graph. The area in red in the following diagram indicates the area allowed.

    **I-i-i-i-i-i-i-I-i-i-<span style=color:rgb(255,0,0)>i-i-i-i-I</span>**

1. You may only use the normal 30 vehicles. You may not use the Super Falcon, Super Stingray, Super Cat, or any custom vehicles.

1. Any glitches/techniques may be used except for pulling the corner of the N64 cartridge and the Air Ground Glitch.

1. Only submit times that are shown on your records screen or on the results screen that is displayed at the end of a race.


## FZC Best and World Record Submission Rules

To have a FZC Best or World Record accepted to FZC, it must follow the requirements of full video proof. If a FZC Best/WR does not adhere to the requirements listed for full video proof, the time is subject to immediate removal from the ladder\*.

Requirements of 'Full Video Proof:'

1. The video must be a **full** recording of the actual run from start of the race to finish.

1. The video must display the ending stats from the race after it is over.

1. If the video is being recorded from a camera and not directly from the source, the player must bring the controller up to the camera at the end of the race and push buttons on the game pad to indicate that what is happening on display is in sync with the players input.

1. The video must always be available to the public. If at any point you remove your video for any too see, FZC witholds the right to take down your time associated with that video.

\*FZC Bests/World Records submitted to FZC previous to the date of March 1st 2013 do not need to adhere by the requirements of 'Full Video Proof.'
