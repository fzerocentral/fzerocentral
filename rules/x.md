1. FZC only accepts times set with the Nintendo 64 game cartridge, the Wii Virtual Console version, the Wii U Virtual Console version, and the Nintendo Switch Online version. Unofficial emulators and flashcarts are not allowed (except flashcarts for the Expansion Kit courses - see below).

1. Submit times only achieved by yourself, don't submit times that have been achieved by a number of people. It is an individual competition it's not meant for team

1. The use of cheat devices such as Action Replay are forbidden on the ladder. If it is suspected that a cheat device has been used then that player will have their times removed from the ladder.

1. Modifying and/or tinkering with the hardware to improve your times is prohibited. things like the Crooked Cartridge glitch (pulling the cart out a bit from the N64 while still playing) and altering the controllers with things such as Lego to make a turbo button are banned. if you have times set using these kind of modifications, they should be changed inmediately.

1. FZC reserves the right to request proof of your times. Proof could be requested at random or a concern that false times may have been submitted. Video proof is the preferred standard but understand that some people are unable to make videos, so photo proof of the records screen is accepted as well. Any requests for proof will be handled by a member of the F-Zero Staff.

1. Multiple accounts for the same player are not allowed, neither are joint accounts.

1. Finally, NO CHEATING of any kind will be tolerated and will result in immediate removal from the ladders and will also be considered for immediate removal in other F-Zero Ladders on FZC.


## Save State Rules for Runs Submitted to Ladder

These rules apply to the Wii U Virtual Console and Nintendo Switch Online releases.

For practice, save states may be used however a player likes. However when submitting runs to the FZC ladder or for WR, save states may only be used as described below. If save states are used anywhere else other than as described below, the player doing so will have their associated time removed.

**3-Laps:** Before the timer of the 3-lap attempt first starts.

**Fast Laps:** Before Boost Power and/or any advanced technique is performed that leads into the fast lap being attempted (example: the save state must be set before starting the AGG setup for a fast lap)


## Normal X ladder and Death Race Ladder Rules

1. Any engine settings may be used.

1. You may only use the normal 30 vehicles. You may not use the Super Falcon, Super Stingray, Super Cat, or any custom vehicles.

1. Any glitches/techniques may be used except for pulling the corner of the N64 cartridge.

1. Only submit times that are shown on your records screen.


## Expansion Kit Ladder Rules

1. All engine settings may be used.

1. You may use any vehicle, including custom vehicles.

1. Any glitches/techniques may be used except for pulling the corner of the N64 cartridge.

1. Only submit times that are shown on your records screen.

### Flashcart Rules

Due to how difficult it is to obtain a 64DD and Expansion Kit and how much flash carts have advanced in the last decade, it's been decided that times set using one of these will be allowed with certain conditions:

1. You must use either an Everdrive 64 v2.5 or v3 or a 64Drive flash cart. these are the only ones tested by the community to work correctly with the FZX + EK combined rom.

1. No cheat codes are allowed. the flash carts posses cheat code functionality but it should be avoided at any cost. patches aren't allowed either.

1. Only the japanese FZX + EK rom is allowed. we want to ensure there's no difference between the game played on real hardware and played with the flash carts. using the unmodified combined rom is the closest to that. also, patching a normal FZX rom with EK tracks is not allowed since there's a couple of differences between the regular rom and the combined rom.

1. When using a flash cart to set times, you must mention it in the comments section.

Proof will be handled in the same fashion as in the rest of the games. that means you need video proof if you get a WR time or very close to it.

Video proof is important given the possibilities of modification, which means times set with a flashcart will be under tighter scrutiny.

as a special note, it's still not allowed to use a flash cart with the regular tracks in the regular ladder.


## Jumper Ladder Rules

1. Only jumper engine settings may be used. This means that the engine setting on the pick-up graph has to be within four ticks of the right side of the graph. The area in red in the following diagram indicates the area allowed.

    **I-i-i-i-i-i-i-I-i-i-<span style=color:rgb(255,0,0)>i-i-i-i-I</span>**

1. You may only use the normal 30 vehicles. You may not use the Super Falcon, Super Stingray, Super Cat, or any custom vehicles.

1. Any glitches/techniques may be used except for pulling the corner of the N64 cartridge and the Air Ground Glitch.

1. Only submit times that are shown on your records screen or on the results screen that is displayed at the end of a race.


## FZC Best and World Record Submission Rules

To have a FZC Best or World Record accepted to FZC, it must follow the requirements of full video proof. If a FZC Best/WR does not adhere to the requirements listed for full video proof, the time is subject to immediate removal from the ladder\*.

Requirements of 'Full Video Proof:'

1. The video must be a **full** recording of the actual run from start of the race to finish.

1. The video must display the ending stats from the race after it is over.

1. If the video is being recorded from a camera and not directly from the source, the player must bring the controller up to the camera at the end of the race and push buttons on the game pad to indicate that what is happening on display is in sync with the players input.

1. The video must always be available to the public. If at any point you remove your video for any too see, FZC witholds the right to take down your time associated with that video.

\*FZC Bests/World Records submitted to FZC previous to the date of March 1st 2013 do not need to adhere by the requirements of 'Full Video Proof.'
