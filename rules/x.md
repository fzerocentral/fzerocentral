1. Accepted ways to play:

    - The original Nintendo 64 game cartridge
    - A flash cartridge ("Flashcart"), with an unaltered ROM of the original game - see the **Flashcart Rules** and **Save State Rules** below
    - The Wii Virtual Console release
    - The Wii U Virtual Console release - the **Save State Rules** below apply to restore points
    - The Switch Online release - the **Save State Rules** below apply to suspend points and rewinds

    Unofficial emulators (such as Mupen64) are not allowed.

1. The use of cheat devices such as Action Replay are forbidden on the ladder. If it is suspected that a cheat device has been used then that player will have their times removed from the ladder.

1. Modifying and/or tinkering with the hardware to improve your times is prohibited. things like the Crooked Cartridge glitch (pulling the cart out a bit from the N64 while still playing) and altering the controllers with things such as Lego to make a turbo button are banned. if you have times set using these kind of modifications, they should be changed inmediately.


## Save State Rules

When submitting runs to the FZC ladder, save states, restore points, etc. may only be used as described below.

**3-Laps:** Before the timer of the 3-lap attempt first starts.

**Fast Laps:** Before Boost Power and/or any advanced technique is performed that leads into the fast lap being attempted (example: the save state must be set before starting the AGG setup for a fast lap)


## Flashcart Rules

1. When playing the Expansion Kit, you must use the unmodified Japanese F-Zero X + Expansion Kit combined ROM. Other configurations, such as a regular F-Zero X ROM patched by unofficial means to add EK tracks, are not allowed. (There are known differences between even the regular Japanese ROM and the base part of the combined ROM.)

1. Only the following flash carts are allowed: Everdrive 64 (v2.5, v3, X5, and X7) and 64Drive. These are the only ones tested by the community to work correctly with F-Zero X and the FZX + EK combined ROM.

Proof will be handled in a similar fashion as times set on a regular cartridge, except that flashcart times may undergo tighter scrutiny, due to the easier access to cheat codes and game patches (both of which are not allowed). Video proof for all times is highly recommended.
