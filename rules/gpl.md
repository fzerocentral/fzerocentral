## Save State Rules

Save states, restore points, etc. may only be used to attempt fast laps and for infinite lives in Grand Prix mode. This means you can set a save state **before entering** a fast lap or you can set a save state **before the timer** in a five lap race **starts**. Misuse of save states constitutes as using a save state **after entering** a fast lap or **after the timer** of a five lap race **starts**.
