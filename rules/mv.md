1. Players are reminded that FZC only accepts times set with the game cartridge, Flash cartridge ("Flashcart") with an unaltered ROM of the original game, the 3DS Ambassador Program version and the Wii U Virtual Console version.

1. Only submit times that are shown on your records screen.

1. The use of cheat devices such as Action Replay are forbidden on the ladder. Restore points on the Wii U VC and Flash cartridge (if that's a possibility) are not to be misused\*. If it is suspected that any cheat devices have been used and/or restore points have been misused, that player will have their times removed from the ladder.

\*Restore points may only be used to attempt fast laps and for infinite lives in Grand Prix mode. This means you can set a restore point **before entering** a fast lap or you can set a restore point **before the timer** in a five lap race **starts**. Misuse of restore points constitutes as using a restore point **after entering** a fast lap or **after the timer** of a five lap race **starts**. Even if a restore point is activated in only the first frame of the fast lap or five lap, your time will be removed, no exceptions. If a player is found abusing the restore point mechanic, their times will be subject to immediate removal from the ladder.


## FZC Best and World Record Submission Rules

To have a FZC Best or World Record accepted to FZC, it must follow the requirements of full video proof. If a FZC Best/WR does not adhere to the requirements listed for full video proof, the time is subject to immediate removal from the ladder\*.

Requirements of 'Full Video Proof:'

1. The video must be a **full** recording of the actual run from start of the race to finish.

1. The video must display the ending stats from the race after it is over (this rule is an exception for GX players who cannot do this if using the replay feature).

1. The video must display the time set by showing it in the records menu.

1. If the video is being recorded from a camera and not directly from the source, the player must bring the controller up to the camera at the end of the race and push buttons on the game pad to indicate that what is happening on display is in sync with the players input.

1. The video must always be available to the public. If at any point you remove your video for any too see, FZC witholds the right to take down your time associated with that video.

\*FZC Bests/World Records submitted to FZC previous to the date of March 1st 2013 do not need to adhere by the requirements of 'Full Video Proof.'
