### 23rd March 2021

added GCLoader to the allowed USB/SD Loader methods

changed "USB Loader" to "USB/SD Loader" for better acurracy

### 17th January 2021

Banned two exploits that take advantage of the Restore feature in Practice Mode that allows to set fast lap times that would not be possible to do in Time Attack mode:

"If you have the Restore feature turned on in practice mode to set a fast lap, the following exploits cannot be used

- Going out of bounds before completing a lap, but still complete the lap as the machine is being restored - [Video Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTdh8jtV9vQ)

- Falling off course immediately after the lap begins in a specific way that makes the machine be restored right before the start/finish line, completing the lap in potentially under 4 seconds - [Video Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DO1HFK9j_c)"

### 17th June 2018

As of the 17th of June 2018, USB Loaders are allowed to use for setting Course Times and Fast Laps.

old rules that prohibited the use of ISOs were removed.

### 5th September 2017

Added a rule for all three ladders to clarify which game modes can be used: "Course Times and Speeds must be obtained using Time Attack mode. Lap Times must be obtained with either Time Attack mode or Practice mode with CPUs off."

Removed "Only submit times that are shown on your records screen." sentence from the "individual competition" rule. Having times saved to your memory card is not a requirement since (1) Spaceflying times below 20 seconds may not save due to a glitch, and (2) Lap Times achieved in Practice mode don't get saved.

### 15th August 2015

As of the 15th of August 2015, the Max Speed rules have been amended to clarify the use of quick turns in straight roads to prevent deliberate Snaking in 100% Max Speed settings and to make things more clear overall.

### 15th September 2014

As of the 15th of September 2014, the replay mode cannot be used as a proof for FZC Bests/World Records anymore.\* (Explanation given on this page: [http://www.fzerocentral.org/viewtopic.php?t=13926&amp;start=0](http://www.fzerocentral.org/viewtopic.php?t=13926&amp;start=0))

The updated rules requires the WR player to do one of the following options:

1. Make a live recording. Video example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDrXT\_nRS\_E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDrXT_nRS_E)

2. Make a recording that starts from the results screen (with the lap splits and such), and ends after the "instant replay mode" (replay mode with the replay icon shown at the bottom left of the screen). Video Example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5sRMcSmLGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5sRMcSmLGs)

If for whatever reason, suspicion were to occur from the above method of providing proof, further proof (such as streaming) could get requested.

\*NOTE: FZC Bests/World Records that used the replay mode as a proof before the 15th of September 2014 are still valid as FZC Bests/World Records.
