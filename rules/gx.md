1. Accepted ways to play:

    - The original GameCube game disc
    - A USB or SD loader, with an unaltered ISO of the original game - see the **USB/SD Loader Rules** below

    Emulators (such as Dolphin) are not allowed.

1. Course Times and Speeds must be obtained using Time Attack mode. Lap Times must be obtained with either Time Attack mode or Practice mode with CPUs off.

1. If you have the Restore feature turned on in practice mode to set a fast lap, the following exploits cannot be used:

    - Going out of bounds before completing a lap, but still complete the lap as the machine is being restored - [Video Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTdh8jtV9vQ)

    - Falling off course immediately after the lap begins in a specific way that makes the machine be restored right before the start/finish line, completing the lap in potentially under 4 seconds - [Video Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DO1HFK9j_c)

1. Players should add in their comments if they played in 50Hz. Times set in 50Hz are not accepted as a "world record", since any version of the game supports 60Hz.

1. The use of cheat devices such as Action Replay are forbidden on all of the ladders. If it is suspected that a cheat device has been used, then that player will have their times removed from the ladder.

    - NOTE: An exception has been made to F-ZERO GX, as Action Replay is the only method available to unlock the Japanese AX event parts. Players should use the AR only once to unlock them.


## USB/SD Loader Rules

Due to the nature of how USB/SD loaders work, a few extra rules are needed to ensure no players obtain unexpected advantages over Disc users.

Methods of USB/SD Loading allowed:

1. HDD or USB stick plugged to the back of a Wii
1. SD Card inserted in the front slot of a Wii
1. SDML adapter on Memory Card slot on GameCube
1. GCLoader Drive Replacement installed on GameCube
1. SD Card inserted in the front slot of a Wii U
1. HDD or USB stick plugged to a USB port on a Wii U

Only these methods have been verified by the Staff and enough testing has been conducted to ensure times set using them are identical to times set with a Disc.

Rules regarding usage of the game:

1. The F-Zero GX image file (ISO) must not be modified in any way. it must be the same image file obtained by reading a F-Zero GX game disc with software capable of creating a backup image of the game. this prevents any possible advantage provided by creating new visual or audio cues.

1. Additional proof for times will be required in the form of Replay files. through testing, it's been determined that Replay files will only sync with game versions that don't have any modifications to machine stats. this ensures players won't be editing the game's files. as a side effect, Story Mode times set on USB/SD Loaders won't be allowed because this form of proof can't be obtained from that mode.

1. USB/SD Loader software such as Nintendont usually comes with functionality for cheat codes. make sure they are turned off when setting times. you're allowed to unlock the Event Parts (Gold Parts) in the same way it is done with Action Replay.


## Max Speed Ladder

1. Times in the GX Max Speed Ladder must be set at 100% Max Speed settings **ONLY.**

1. No checkpoint skipping is allowed to be used in the Max Speed ladder. This includes the use of this shortcut on PRSLS: [http://wrvids.com/F-Zero\_series/F-Zero GX/prsls\_midiman\_nazo.mpg](http://wrvids.com/F-Zero_series/F-Zero%20GX/prsls_midiman_nazo.mpg)

1. Quickturn alternations with custom machines with a body of E/D are banned, unless if it is naturally required by the track, either by a curve, or to align a certain position and angle. This rule has been done to prevent snaking with custom vehicles.

1. Side Attacks are allowed to be used, but HSSA (Hyper Speed Side Attack) is not allowed.

**(Not ladder rules!)** - Below are the rules applied to the Non-Side Attack category displayed in the [WR List](http://www.fzerocentral.org/viewtopic.php?t=13710):

1. 100% Max Speed settings ONLY.

1. No checkpoint skipping is allowed to be used in the Non-SA category. This includes the use of this shortcut on PRSLS: [http://wrvids.com/F-Zero\_series/F-Zero GX/prsls\_midiman\_nazo.mpg](http://wrvids.com/F-Zero_series/F-Zero%20GX/prsls_midiman_nazo.mpg)

1. Side Attacks are not allowed.

1. Machines with a body rating of E or D are not allowed.


## Snaking Ladder

1. Times in the GX Snaking Ladder must be set at 0% (Max Acceleration) settings **ONLY.**

1. No checkpoint skipping is allowed to be used in the Snaking ladder. This includes the use of this shortcut on PRSLS: [http://wrvids.com/F-Zero\_series/F-Zero GX/prsls\_midiman\_nazo.mpg](http://wrvids.com/F-Zero_series/F-Zero%20GX/prsls_midiman_nazo.mpg)

1. Snaking patterns in the air are only allowed to be performed **ONCE** when using a machine that weighs less than 2050kg. This has been done to prevent unintentional flying.

1. Flying through the whole course, even without skipping checkpoints, is prohibited.

1. Side Attacks are allowed to be used, but HSSA (Hyper Speed Side Attack) is not allowed.


## Open Ladder

1. Times in the GX Open Ladder can be set at any setting. This ladder allows the use of Snaking, Space Flying, and Non-Snaking.

1. Checkpoint skipping is also allowed in this ladder.

1. HSSA (Hyper Speed Side Attack) is allowed in this ladder.


## FZC Best and World Record Submission Rules

In order to have an FZC Best or World Record to be accepted to FZC, one must follow the requirements of "full video proof". If an FZC Best/WR does not adhere to the requirements listed for "full video proof", the time is subject to immediate removal from the ladder.\*

Requirements of "Full Video Proof":

1. The video must be a **full** recording of the actual run from start of the race to finish.

1. The video *should* display the ending stats from the race after it is over.

1. If the video is being recorded from a camera and not directly from the source, the player must bring the controller up to the camera at the end of the race and push buttons on the game pad to indicate that what is happening on display is in sync with the players input.

1. The video must always be available to the public. If at any point you remove your video from public, FZC witholds the right to take down your time associated with that video.

\*FZC Bests/World Records submitted to FZC previous to the date of March 1st 2013, does not need to adhere by the requirements of "Full Video Proof".
