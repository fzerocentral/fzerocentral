    <font size=5>Basic Ladder Rules</font>
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=font-family:Arial>1. Turbo Controllers are banned from being used on the Ladder as they present the player with an unfair advantage. Players are reminded that if they have any&nbsp;times set with a turbo controller they must change them&nbsp;immediately.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=font-family:Arial>2. FZC accepts times set with the game cartridge, Flash cartridge ("Flashcart") with an unaltered ROM of the original game and the Wii U Virtual Console using the standard rules for all games. Emulators are allowed in this game due to the fact it is very hard to obtain the game cartridge these days due to it's original limited release but need an additional set of rules to ensure people playing under these conditions have a setup as close as possible to people playing with Official Releases. see Emulator Rules below for a detailed explanation of the rules applying to Emulator users.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=font-family:Arial>3. Submit times only achieved by yourself, don't submit times that have been achieved by a number of people. It is an individual competition it's not meant for teams. Only submit times that are shown on your records screen.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=font-family:Arial>4. The use of cheat devices such as Action Replay are forbidden on the ladder. Restore points on the Wii U VC or save-states for mGBA are not to be misused. See Save State Rules below for a detailed explaination. <br>
    <br> 5. FZC reserves the right to request proof of your times. Proof could be requested at random or a concern that false times may have been submitted. Video proof is the preferred standard but understand that some people are unable to make videos, so photo proof of the records screen is accepted as well. Any requests for proof will be handled by a member of the F-Zero Staff. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=font-family:Arial>6. Multiple accounts for the same player are not allowed, neither are joint accounts.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=font-family:Arial>7. Finally, NO CHEATING of any kind will be tolerated and will result in immediate removal from the ladders and will also be considered for immediate removal in other F-Zero Ladders on FZC.</span>

  <font size=5>F-Zero Climax Emulator Rules</font>
</p>
<p>Because of the nature of unofficial Emulators, some extra rules are needed to allow times set when using them and prevent abuse or cheating as much as possible.</p>
<p>The following are rules to be followed when setting times in F-Zero Climax while playing on emulator:</p>
<p>- The only allowed emulator as of right now is mGBA desktop version 0.8.x. If a new major version comes out it will first be investigated before being accepted. <br> - Video proof must capture the entire emulator window, including the title bar which shows the FPS and version number. you are allowed to rearrange the screen layout but there must be at least one window showing the requested information unaltered. <br> - Video proof is required for top 10 times and the video must be linked in the Video Link field of your submission. videos don't have a limit in quality and at minimum should be recorded using the GBA's native resolution (240x160) and framerate. <br> - The game must run at full speed at all times. if your computer experiences slowdowns from having many programs open at once, close them until the emulator runs well. If the video causes the slowdown, lower video quality until there's no slowdown. <br> - You must choose "mGBA [version used]" in the Platform field of your submission. </p>
<p>And furthermore, instructions for setting up the emulator: <br> 1. Download and install an allowed version of mGBA at <a href=https://mgba.io/downloads.html>https://mgba.io/downloads.html</a>
  <br> 2. By default all settings are correct, but ensure the following: <br> - Frameskip is set to 0 <br> - Ensure cheats are disabled / there are no cheats loaded <br> - Do not bind autofire to prevent accidental use <br> - FPS target should be "Native (59.7275)" <br> 3 (Optional). If you want to use an existing save data with everything unlocked, you can download the following file and place it in the same folder as your ROM with the same name as your ROM <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16BbTwqw1vAPY2U8EUfa3ueQ0g-h2BJOz/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/16BbTwqw1vAPY2U8EUfa3ueQ0g-h2BJOz/view?usp=sharing</a>

  </li>
  <li>
    <span style=font-family:Arial>
      <span style=color:rgb(0,0,0)>The video must always be available to the public. If at any point you remove your video for any to see, FZC reserves the right to take down your time associated with that video.</span>
