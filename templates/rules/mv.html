<p>
  <span style=font-family:Arial>1. Turbo Controllers are banned from being used on the Ladder as they present the player with an unfair advantage. Players are reminded that if they have any&nbsp;times set with a turbo controller they must change them&nbsp;immediately.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=font-family:Arial>2. Times set on Maximum Velocity using the multiplayer link are not allowed to be submitted on FZC. The reason&nbsp;is due to the chance to gain a large amount of "speed bumps" by your friend which would&nbsp;enable you to get a faster time than is possible when racing against the COM.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=font-family:Arial>3. Players are reminded that FZC only accepts times set with the game cartridge,&nbsp;</span>
  <span style=font-family:Arial>Flash cartridge ("Flashcart") with an unaltered ROM of the original game, the 3DS Ambassador Program version</span>
  <span style=font-family:Arial>&nbsp;and the Wii U Virtual Console version.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=font-family:Arial>4. Submit times only achieved by yourself, don't submit times that have been achieved by a number of people. It is an individual competition it's not meant for teams. Only submit times that are shown on your records screen.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=font-family:Arial>5. The use of cheat devices such as Action Replay are forbidden on the ladder. Restore points on the Wii U VC </span>
  <span style=font-family:Arial>and Flash cartridge (if that's a possibility) are not to be misused*. If it is suspected that any cheat devices have been used and/or restore points have been misused, that player will have their times removed from the ladder.&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=font-family:Arial>6. FZC reserves the right to request proof of your times. Proof could be requested at random or a concern that false times may have been submitted. Video proof is the preferred standard but understand that some people are unable to make videos, so photo proof of the records screen is accepted as well. Any requests for proof will be handled by a member of the F-Zero Staff.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=font-family:Arial>7. Multiple accounts for the same player are not allowed, neither are joint accounts.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=font-family:Arial>8. Finally, NO CHEATING of any kind will be tolerated and will result in immediate removal from the ladders and will also be considered for immediate removal in other F-Zero Ladders on FZC.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=font-family:Arial>*Restore points may only be used to attempt fast laps and for infinite lives in Grand Prix mode. This means you can set a restore point <strong>before</strong>
    <strong>entering</strong> a fast lap or you can set a restore point <strong>before</strong>
    <strong>the timer</strong> in a five lap race <strong>starts</strong>. Misuse of restore points constitutes as using a restore point <strong>after entering</strong> a fast lap or <strong>after the timer</strong> of a five lap race <strong> starts</strong>. Even if a restore point is activated in only the first frame of the fast lap or five lap, your time will be removed, no exceptions. If a player is found abusing the restore point mechanic, their times will be subject to immediate removal from the ladder. </span>
