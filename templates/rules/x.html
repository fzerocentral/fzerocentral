    <span style=font-size:x-large>Rules for all F-Zero X Ladders</span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp; <span style=font-family:Arial>1. Turbo Controllers are banned from being used on the FZX Ladder as they present the player with an unfair advantage. <strong>Players are reminded that if they have any&nbsp;times set with a turbo controller they must change them&nbsp;immediately.</strong>
    </span>
    <span style=font-family:Arial></span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style=font-family:Arial>2. Players are reminded that FZC only accepts times set with the game cartridge, the Wii Virtual Console version and the Wii U Virtual Console version. There shall be no exceptions made for allowing people to submit times set using a ROM. Any times that are found to have been set using a ROM will be deleted. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style=font-family:Arial></span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style=font-family:Arial>3. Submit times only achieved by yourself, don't submit times that have been achieved by a number of people. It is an individual competition it's not meant for team</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style=font-family:Arial>4. The use of cheat devices such as Action Replay are forbidden on the ladder. If it is suspected that a cheat device has been used then that player will have their times removed from the ladder.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style=font-family:Arial>5. Modifying and/or tinkering with the hardware to improve your times&nbsp;is prohibited. things like the Crooked Cartridge glitch (pulling the cart out a bit&nbsp;from the N64 while still playing) and altering the controllers with things such as Lego to make a turbo button&nbsp;are banned. if you have times set using these kind of modifications, they should be changed inmediately.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style=font-family:Arial>6. FZC reserves the right to request proof of your times. Proof could be requested at random or a concern that false times may have been submitted. Video proof is the preferred standard but understand that some people are unable to make videos, so photo proof of the records screen is accepted as well. Any requests for proof will be handled by a member of the F-Zero Staff.&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style=font-family:Arial>7. Multiple accounts for the same player are not allowed, neither are joint accounts.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style=font-family:Arial>8. Finally, NO CHEATING of any kind will be tolerated and will result in immediate removal from the ladders and will also be considered for immediate removal in other F-Zero Ladders on FZC.</span>

    <span style=font-size:x-large>Save State Rules for Runs Submitted to Ladder <br>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p style=text-align:center>For practice, save states may be used however a player likes. However when submitting runs to the FZC ladder or for WR, save states may only be used as described below. If save states are used anywhere else other than as described below, the player doing so will have their associated time removed.</p>
  <p>
    <span style=font-size:large>3-Laps</span>
  </p>
  <p>Before the timer of the 3-lap attempt first starts.</p>
  <p>
    <span style=font-size:large>Fast Laps</span>
  </p>
  <p>Before Boost Power and/or any advanced technique is performed that leads into the fast lap being attempted (example: the save state must be set before starting the AGG setup for a fast lap)</p>

      <span style=font-family:Arial>Flashcart Rules</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style=font-family:Arial>Due to how difficult it is to obtain a 64DD and Expansion Kit and how much flash carts have advanced in the last decade, it's been decided that times set using one of these will be allowed with certain conditions:</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style=font-family:Arial>1. You must use either an Everdrive 64 v2.5 or v3 or a 64Drive flash cart. these are the only ones tested by the community to work correctly with the FZX + EK combined rom.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style=font-family:Arial>2. No cheat codes are allowed. the flash carts posses cheat code functionality but it should be avoided at any cost. patches aren't allowed either.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style=font-family:Arial>3. Only the japanese FZX + EK rom is allowed. we want to ensure there's no difference between the game played on real hardware and played with the flash carts. using the unmodified combined rom is the closest to that. also, patching a normal FZX rom with EK tracks is not allowed since there's a couple of differences between the regular rom and the combined rom.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style=font-family:Arial>4. When using a flash cart to set times, you must mention it in the comments section.</span>
  </p>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <p>
    <span style=font-family:Arial>Proof will be handled in the same fashion as in the rest of the games. that means you need video proof if you get a WR time or very close to it.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style=font-family:Arial>Video proof is important given the possibilities of modification, which means times set with a flashcart will be under tighter scrutiny.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style=font-family:Arial>as a special note, it's still not allowed to use a flash cart with the regular tracks in the regular ladder.</span>

      <br>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style=font-family:Arial>1. Only jumper engine settings may be used.&nbsp; This means that the engine setting on the pick-up graph has to be within four ticks of the right side of the graph.&nbsp; The area in red in the following diagram indicates the area allowed.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>I-i-i-i-i-i-i-I-i-i- <span style=color:rgb(255,0,0)>i-i-i-i-I</span>

  <p>
    <span style=font-family:Arial>2. You may only use the normal 30 vehicles.&nbsp; You may not use the Super Falcon, Super Stingray, Super Cat, or any custom vehicles.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style=font-family:Arial>3. Any glitches/techniques may be used except for pulling the corner of the N64 cartridge and the Air Ground Glitch.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style=font-family:Arial>4. Only submit times that are shown on your records screen or on the results screen that is displayed at the end of a race. <br>

      <span style=font-family:Arial>s from the race after it is over.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style=font-family:Arial>If the video is being recorded from a camera and not directly from the source, the player must bring the controller up to the camera at the end of the race and push buttons on the game pad to indicate that what is happening on display is in sync with the players input.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style=font-family:Arial>
        <span style=color:rgb(0,0,0)>The video must always be available to the public. If at any point you remove your video for any too see, FZC witholds the right to take down your time associated with that video.</span>
